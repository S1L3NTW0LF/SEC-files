Analysis of financial forms from the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commision)

The objective of the project:
1. is to extract the appropriate data (Ex. 10-K) from two folders (submissions and companyfacts) which contain json files 
2. and build a dataframe
3. then build and test financial models using machine learning

The hope is to build something that be used in real life to trade stocks.
